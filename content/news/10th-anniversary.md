Meanwhile, we are working towards a new playtest. Some core improvements and additions are:
<ul>
<li>A new unit control bar that provides mouse and touch accessibility.</li>
<li>Unit stances that are easier to use and behave more like the original games.</li>
<li>Overhauled structure hit boxes, with weapons/engineers/etc. accounting for their physical size instead of acting only at their centre.</li>
<li>Automatic discovery of LAN games.</li>
</ul>

So stay tuned and happy playing!
